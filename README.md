## Projects that use Bluey

These are demo projects we have built using **bluey**.

- [SensorTest][1] - outputs all sensor data via UART/USB.
- [SensorTestBLE][2] - defines custom service to send sensor data via BLE.
- [BlueyBotSimple][3] - a simple phone controlled 2WD robot.
- [Blueybeacon][4] - displaying sensor data on web using a Raspberry Pi as gateway.

## Coming Soon...

Some of the things that we are working on...

- Data logging
- HID on Raspberry Pi
- Pedometer
- Object Tracker
