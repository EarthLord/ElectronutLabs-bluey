## MeArm using Bluey.

This is an example project to demonstrate the use of Bluey to control MeArm over BLE.

MeArm design files can be found [here](https://github.com/mimeindustries/MeArm) and instructions on building your MeArm can be fund [here](http://learn.mime.co.uk/docs/control-your-mearm-from-arduino/)

In our application, we use Bluey as the processing unit to control MeArm and wireless communication unit to obtain data from a smartphone.
